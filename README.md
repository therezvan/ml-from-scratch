# Machine Learning From Scratch

This repository contains a collection of **machine learning algorithms implemented from scratch in Python** as part of my academic and self-study work.

## Implemented Projects

### 1. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Ordinary, Heap-based and KD-tree implementations
- K-Fold Cross-Validation
- Breast Cancer classification

### 2. Linear Regression
- Closed-form solution
- Gradient Descent optimization
- Error analysis

### 3. Logistic Regression
- Binary and multiclass classification
- Gradient Descent
- Evaluation metrics

Each project is fully self-contained and includes:
- Dataset
- Source code
- Documentation
- Experimental results

## Technologies
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
